Tiny Messenger
=========

tiny html-css javascript based messenger

This is a small demo application developed to learn HML5, CSS3 and Javascript. It implements a small messenger using window to window messaging. To operate it, simply load the serverwindow.html file in a browser.

By entering a name and clicking new user, it can simulate the action of users connecting to the server. The added user will appear on the connected user list and a new window will open.

The new window is the messenger window.

For every new user a new windows will open and the list of connected users will be updated on both server and all client windows.

To connect and talk to another user via the messenger a user can select a recipients from the connected user's list and click on connect.

The recipient will receive a message asking to accept the connection. If the connection is accepted the connection will be added to the tab list of both sender and recipient and the message exchange will start.
